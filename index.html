                 <h3>Plans for the future </h3>   
                 <p>I hope to someday turn my hobby of home automation and security research into a full time profession. I currently spend my free time building and deploying sensor devices based on the esp32 microcontroller to control various aspects of my smart home. My favorite implementations so far have been circadian rythim base lights and room by room presence detection</p>

                 <h3>A little about my past</h3>
                 <p>I am returning back to school after 10 years away working as a professional chef. I attended culinary school at the Culinary Institute of America and worked in fine dining as well as for private clients up and down the east coast. Check out some of my dishes below! </p>

                 <h3>What do you do besides Computers and technology?</h3>
                 <p>I recently took up the sport of disc golfing where I play in a weekly league in North Jersey at Greystone Disc Golf Course. I am an avid documentary buff and consume video essays at a voracious speed.  </p>

                 <h3>Because everyone always asks!</h3>
                 <p>My favorite dish to cook is roast pork tenderloin with a fig demi glace and chive smashed red bliss potatoes. Im working on a website to share all of my favorite recipes so stay tuned!</p>

            <h2>Bringing Web Designs to Life with CSS Animation</h2>
            <div>

              <p>In the vibrant world of web design, the ability to animate elements is not just a feature—it's a doorway to enhanced interactivity and user engagement. CSS animations breathe life into static pages, making the user experience more dynamic and engaging. They allow elements to gracefully transition between styles, adding depth and personality to web interfaces Unlike static designs, animations can guide a user's attention, indicate actions, and add a layer of interactivity to a web page. In this blog post, we'll delve into the essentials of CSS animations, exploring how they work, their advantages, and some best practices for implementing them effectively..</p>

              <p>The foundation of CSS animations lies in the @keyframes rule, which allows designers to define the stages and style changes that an element will undergo during an animation. This is where the magic happens – by specifying keyframes, you can create complex animations that go beyond simple transitions. To control these animations, CSS offers a suite of properties such as animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, and animation-direction. These properties give you precise control over how the animation behaves, from its speed and duration to its repetition and direction.</p>

              <p>Imagine a simple animation of a ball bouncing. The CSS keyframes define the movement (up and down motion), while properties like 'animation-duration' control how fast the ball bounces. </p>

              <p> Here's a CSS snippet for a bouncing ball:</p>
                <p>
                  <code>
                      lit .ball {
                      width: 100px;
                      height: 100px;
                      border-radius: 50%;
                      background-color: #4AA2FF;
                    
                      animation: bounce 0.5s;
                      animation-direction: alternate;
                      animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(.5,0.05,1,.5);
                      animation-iteration-count: infinite;
                    }
                    
                    @keyframes bounce {
                      from { transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);     }
                      to   { transform: translate3d(0, 1.25rem, 0); }
                    }
                  </code>
               </p>

              <p>And here is that snippet in action!</p>
              <div class="ball"></div>

              <p>One of the key benefits of using CSS animations is the enhanced user experience they offer. Animations can make a website feel more interactive and responsive, providing visual cues and feedback in response to user actions. They can guide users through a flow, draw attention to important elements, or simply add a touch of creativity to a website's design.</p>

              <p>However, the use of CSS animations extends beyond mere aesthetics. They are often more performance-friendly compared to JavaScript-based animations, particularly for simple effects. This is crucial for ensuring a smooth user experience, especially on devices with limited processing power like smartphones and tablets. Additionally, CSS animations are well-supported across modern web browsers, eliminating the need for additional plugins or complex coding.</p>

              <p>When implementing CSS animations, it's important to adhere to some best practices. Firstly, subtlety is key. Overusing animations can overwhelm users and detract from the site's primary content. Aim for a balance where animations enhance the user experience without being distracting. Secondly, consider the performance implications of your animations. Test them across different devices and browsers to ensure they don't negatively impact your site's loading times or responsiveness. Finally, be mindful of accessibility concerns. Some users may have sensitivities to motion or animations, so providing options to reduce or disable animations can make your site more inclusive.</p>

              <p>In conclusion, CSS animations are a powerful tool in a web designer's arsenal. They offer a way to bring websites to life, making them more engaging and interactive. By understanding the basics of how they work, recognizing their benefits, and following best practices, you can effectively integrate animations into your web designs to create memorable and user-friendly experiences.</p>
