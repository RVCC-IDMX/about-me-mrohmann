                 <h6>Plans for the future </h6>   
                 <p>I hope to someday turn my hobby of home automation and security research into a full time profession.</p>
                 <h6>A little about my past</h6>
                 <p>I am returning back to school after 10 years away working as a professional chef. I attended culinary school and worked in fine dining as well as for private clients up and down the east coast."</p>
                 <h6>What do you do besides Computers and technology?</h6>
                 <p>I recently took up the sport of disc golfing where I play in a weelky league in North Jersey. I am an avid documentary buff and consume video essays at a voracious speed. </p>
                 <h6>Because everyone always asks!</h6>
                 <p>My favorite dish to cook is roast pork tenderloin with a fig demi glace and chive smashed red bliss potatoes.</p>
