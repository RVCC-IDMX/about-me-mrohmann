# Description
This website is designed to showcase the skills learned during Web Development I at Raritan Valley Community College. It is hosted on Netlify for easy deployment from Github.

  ## Nav Bar
The navigation bar section of this project provides direct links to the different sections within the webpage. This is achieved by linking the respective sections by their name.

  ## Gallery
The gallery section of this page introduced the concept of linking images into a site. It is important when including images to a webpage to include alternate text for those who have accessibility issue.

  ## Hobbies
The hobbies section was important to introduce the concept of  lists and how they are useful for webpages. This section provides additional links to outside content that is relevant to the main page.

  ## Blog
The blog section was instrumental in learning on how to format text for a readable page across different size screens. As the screen size changes, it is important to adjust font sizes and layout options to allow the text to be most readable. 

# Color Scheme
The Vaporwave color palette is inspired by the aesthetics of the 1980s and 1990s, with its bright, neon colors and pastel hues. It is often used to evoke a feeling of nostalgia and to create a dream-like atmosphere. The colors are often used to create a surreal, futuristic vibe, and the palette often includes blues, pinks, purples, and greens.
